Run the file on terminal as
python passwdparser.py "<path to /etc/passwd file>" "<path to /etc/group file>"

Ex: python passwdparser.py /etc/passwd /etc/group

The output will be written to a file by the name output.json. Path for this can be changed in invoker() function
output.json file will get updated at each run of file in cron job storing the current state by parsing of passwd and group files.

At the end after the execution of invoker function we get a json obj returned by the function and I've also printed it to the terminal for reference.
